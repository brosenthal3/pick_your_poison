# pick_your_poison

This is a project made for the Human Computer Interaction and Information Visualization course (24/25) at Leiden University.

Pick Your Poison is a mushroom customizer app, that allows users to customize a dynamic mushroom template with 10+ different features and endless options.
Our ML algorithms predict the most similar real-life mushroom species and its toxicity: is your mushroom design poisonous or edible?

## TODO - software aspects:
* implement scrollable widget for mushroom options
* set up global state
* implement onClicked functions for all mushroom options to update global state
* make widget that dynamically creates mushroom based on global state (also design)

## TODO - design aspects:
* improve everything about the design (i made it ugly, sorry..)
* add all assets in a logical way
* integrate assets into dynamic mushroom design widget
* add loading screens and animations where might be needed

## TODO - AI integration:
* add asynch code to communicate with API during each global state change
* integrate all information from predictions dynamically into the prediction pages
* Include queries to more information about the species, or include data locally
